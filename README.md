# Webcam-Air-Paint
With the advancement of modern technologies areas related to computer vision and real time image processing has become a major technology under consideration. Our aim in this project is to combine the processes of object detection, colour detection and object tracking to implement what can be used as a virtual drawing board. Our proposed software detects objects from the webcam in real-time and tracks their movement to replicate the objectâ€™s path of motion as a drawing on the screen. A colour detection module is embedded which to allow only objects of a particular colour (blue here) to be used as the painting stick. All this will be achieved using the OpenCV library of Python. By using open source computer vision library (OpenCV for short), an image can be captured on the bases of its hue, saturation and colour value (HSV) range. The basic library functions for image handling and processing are used. The new features which we will attempt to embed in this project are the following; 1. Touch-less interface 2. Any object of any colour and size can be used 3. Automatic colour detection and selection based on the object's colour 4. Infant-friendly application which can be used to teach colours in fun way 5. Interactive and engaging interface for autistic patients
